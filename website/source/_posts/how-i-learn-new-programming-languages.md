So if you see my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wasimaster) You may see that I know a lot of programming language and frameworks. And you may (or may not) be wondering how I learnt all those in such a young age or do I even know all those. The answer to the first question will be given in this post and the answer to the second question would be given tomorrow

## Prerequisites to learn new programming languages

The first thing I'd suggest is for you to become fluent in coding fundamentals. After you learn to code in one programming language, other languages will be easier to learn.

> \- Chinese proverb

You should start with one then learn more. You must remember, computational thinking and the coding fundamentals apply to every programming language no matter the complexity. If you already know one language you can move on the learning new languages.

## First learn the basics

First learn the basics of the language then move on to libraries and frameworks. At first if you start out with too much then you will give up easily. A good site to learn the basics of a programming language really fast is [learnxinyminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) Or if you want a broader selection containing programming languages, frameworks mathematics etc. check out [codecademy's list of cheat sheets](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/cheatsheets/all)

## Then code something

The next thing you should do is to code something other than Hello World. Try new projects, see [a list of projects to code](https://github.com/karan/Projects#readme) and pick one then try it. You should try a few more projects until you think you understand all concepts. I personally keep a [git repository of all of these projects i do](https://github.com/wasi-master/coding-challenges), You may also want to do the same. Speaking of understanding all concepts

## You must make sure you understand what you're doing

The common mistake I often see beginners make is that they use tutorials too much, I do agree tutorials are good for teaching a specific thing in a specific way. But for programming you must be creative and be able to build your own stuff too not just stuff made by others in tutorials. Copying code from stackoverflow is also simillar, You should not copy code you don't understand, trust me it will cause issues later down the line.

## General tips

- **Read the documentation**
    This is something I see a lot of people hate specially people just starting out with programming. documentation is important and you must take advantage of it.
- **Coding challenges**
    You should try coding challenges with your new language with sites such as [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [exercism](https://exercism.org/), [edabit](https://edabit.com/), [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives), [codewars](https://www.codewars.com), [codingame](https://www.codingame.com/)
- **Find a coding partner**
    Find someone that codes in the language you want to learn, this can be a <abbr title="In Real Life">irl</abbr> friend, family or even a discord buddy
- **Learn to ask for help**
    Whatever language you wish to learn be sure to ask for help when you get stuck somewhere, this can be in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) or [google](https://www.google.com) or ask in programming specific [reddit](https://www.reddit.com) and [discord](https://discord.com) communities
- **Take breaks**
    You don't have to sit in front of a computer for hours and hours at a time. Try to take breaks and do the other things you have to do except programming. Sometimes you spend hours and hours to find the bug but you don't get the solution for your code so it's good to take a short break. It will restore your focus and help you find solutions to your problems
